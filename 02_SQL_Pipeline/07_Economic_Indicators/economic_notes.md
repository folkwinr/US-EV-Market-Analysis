# 📊 Economic Indicators Module  
**Folder:** `07_Economic_Indicators`  
**Files:**
- `ev_per_million_gas.sql`
- `fuel_diversity_index.sql`
- `alt_fuel_market_share.sql`

This module contains independent economic KPIs commonly used in EV policy,
energy planning, and market maturity analysis.

---

## 📌 1. EV per 1 Million Gasoline Vehicles  
**Purpose:** Measures EV maturity relative to traditional ICE vehicle stock.  
A higher value means a more advanced EV market.

Useful for:
- Infrastructure planning  
- Market maturity scoring  
- Cross-state EV adoption comparison  

---

## 📌 2. Fuel Diversity Index (FDI)  
**Purpose:** Counts how many alternative fuel types exceed relevance thresholds.  
Represents the *complexity* and *diversification* of a state’s energy ecosystem.

High FDI → more diverse fuel adoption → greater energy flexibility.

---

## 📌 3. Alternative Fuel Market Share  
**Purpose:** Measures how much each state contributes to total U.S. alt-fuel usage.

Used for:
- Federal policy planning  
- Investment prioritization  
- Identifying strategic states for alt-fuel expansion   

---

## 📁 Output Summary

- Market maturity ranking  
- Energy system diversity score  
- State contribution to national alternative fuel usage  
- Top 10 strategic alt-fuel states  

---

## 📝 Notes  
These KPIs are often used in:
- U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) reports  
- Transportation electrification strategies  
- Energy policy modelling  
- Infrastructure rollout prioritization  

This module is intentionally broken into **three standalone SQL files**  
because each represents a distinct economic metric.
