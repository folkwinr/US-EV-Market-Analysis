## 📌 Key Analyses

### **1. National-Level Alt-Fuel Percentages**
Shows how each fuel contributes to the overall U.S. vehicle fuel mix.

### **2. National Alt-Fuel Totals**
Helps identify which fuels have scale vs which are niche.

---

### **3. Alt-Fuel Percentage per State**
Measures the share of alt-fuels in each state's total vehicle population.

---

### **4. Niche Fuel Variety Index**
Counts how many alternative fuel types exceed meaningful thresholds.  
Useful for understanding energy system complexity.

---

### **5. State-Level Market Contribution**
Ranks states by how much they contribute to total U.S. alternative fuel usage.

---

### **6. Fuel Ordering by State**
Creates state-specific fuel priority ordering (e.g. *Biodiesel > E85 > Propane*).  
Extremely useful for dashboards and comparative analytics.
